# React Node Netflix

Example of Netflix's Browse Page built with React Hooks & Node.js. I'm currently still working on part 3, whatever I have done is the same code you see on the master branch.

If you have any problems running this on your machine, just post an issue here, and I will answer it.

## Use

- `git clone https://github.com/DZuz14/react-node-netflix.git`
- `cd react-node-netflix`
- `npm i`
- `npm start`

If your browser does not automatically open, visit `http://localhost:8080`
